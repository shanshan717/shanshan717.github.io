## About me

I’m Shanshan Zhu, a Master’s student in Psychology focused on the self and memory using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am also exploring how deep learning can be integrated with cognitive neuroscience and translated into practical applications.

I received my B.A. in Health Services and Management from Hangzhou Normal University and am currently pursuing my Master's degree at Nanjing Normal University under the supervision of Prof. Hu Chuan-Peng.

Outside of research, I enjoy running, photography, and DIY crafts. Feel free to explore the site to learn more!
