## Academic Experience

**Self-Reference Modulates Stimulus Representations in Visual Cortex** | *Project Leader* | Since 12/2024

*Advisors: Prof. Hu Chuan-Peng and Assoc. Prof. Yan Chu-Yao*

Designed and conducted a comprehensive behavioral and neuroimaging study examining how self-related information influences memory representations and retrieval accessibility in early visual perception. Responsibilities include data collection (behavioral and MRI), data processing and behavioral analysis using R, and functional MRI analysis using Python.

**A Cognitive Ontological Neuroimaging Meta Database for Self-Referential Processing** | *Project Leader* | Since 11/2023

*Advisor: Prof. Hu Chuan-Peng*

Developed a structured database summarizing how self-referential encoding affects memory processes across studies. Contributed to codebook development, systematic literature review, key information extraction, and dataset organization for public sharing and reuse by researchers.

**Neuroimaging Meta-Analysis of Self-Referential Processing Across Psychiatric Disorders** | *Project Leader* | 02/2024–01/2026

*Advisor: Prof. Hu Chuan-Peng*

Conducted a coordinate-based fMRI meta-analysis to identify altered neural responses to self-referential judgments in psychiatric disorders. Key tasks included literature screening, data extraction, and Python-based computational analysis.

**The Impact of Legal Professional Education on Moral and Legal Reasoning** | *Major Contributor* | Since 05/2024

*Advisor: Prof. Hu Chuan-Peng*

Analyzed behavioral and brain-imaging data to understand how legal training influences decision-making. Performed data cleaning, statistical modeling, interpretation of results, and manuscript writing.

**Chinese Child Brain Development Project** | *MRI Operator* | Since 11/2024

*Advisor: Prof. Hu Chuan-Peng*

Operated MRI scans for children aged 6–8, including pre-scan familiarization to reduce anxiety, motion monitoring, and acquisition of resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data.
